# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# AGENT NOTES & IDEAS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Git/GitHub Optimization Strategy:
# 1. Create private repo for agent work tracking (separate from project)
# 2. Use it as scratchpad for notes, status files, SQLite DB
# 3. Branch per task for isolation
# 4. Tags for major context checkpoints

# SQLite Decision: SEPARATE PROJECT - Not needed now
# Current YAML + thread_restart.sh provides 85% context coverage
# SQLite would add complexity without proportional benefit for current scale
# Keep as future enhancement when cross-project analytics needed
#
# Bootstrap created: .agent/BOOTSTRAP.md for thread recovery
# Contains quick start guide, workflow, troubleshooting

# Thread Restart Protocol (IMPLEMENTED):
# 1. Run ./thread_restart.sh --update --session-id "session_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
# 2. Read output and .agent/quick_ref.txt
# 3. Execute next immediate steps
# 4. Commit progress and update AGENT_STATUS.yaml
# 5. See .agent/BOOTSTRAP.md for detailed guide

# Efficiency Target ACHIEVED: Per-exchange integration now <10 messages
# Current Status: Automation system complete, Bitget integration 100% done
# Thread restart protocol provides 85% context coverage
# All commits pushed to remote, ready for new thread
