# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# AGENT NOTES & IDEAS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Git/GitHub Optimization Strategy:
# 1. Create private repo for agent work tracking (separate from project)
# 2. Use it as scratchpad for notes, status files, SQLite DB
# 3. Branch per task for isolation
# 4. Tags for major context checkpoints

# SQLite Schema Ideas:
# CREATE TABLE agent_work (
#   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
#   session_id TEXT,
#   task TEXT,
#   start_time TIMESTAMP,
#   end_time TIMESTAMP,
#   git_commit_hash TEXT,
#   outcome TEXT,
#   notes TEXT
# );
#
# CREATE TABLE exchange_progress (
#   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
#   name TEXT,
#   status TEXT,
#   start_time TIMESTAMP,
#   completion_time TIMESTAMP,
#   products_count INTEGER,
#   coverage_percent REAL,
#   agent_session_id TEXT
# );

# Thread Restart Protocol:
# 1. Read AGENT_STATUS.yaml first
# 2. Check git status and recent commits
# 3. Continue from last task or follow next_steps
# 4. Update AGENT_STATUS.yaml with progress

# Efficiency Target: Reduce per-exchange integration to <10 messages
# Current Status: Automation created, testing needed with Bitget fix
